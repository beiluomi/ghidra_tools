# Tenable Ghidra Tools

This is a repository of Ghidra-related tools and scripts open-sourced by Tenable.



## Tools

* [extract.py](https://github.com/tenable/ghidra_tools/tree/main/extract_decomps) - Python script that makes use of the Ghidra Bridge to extract all decompiled functions from Ghirda
* [g3po.py](https://github.com/tenable/ghidra_tools/tree/main/g3po) - Jython script that queries OpenAI's large language models (gpt-3.5-turbo by default, but compatible with gpt-4) for explanatory comments on decompiled functions.
